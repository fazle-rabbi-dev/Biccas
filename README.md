# 🌐 Biccas - Saas landing page

A pixel-perfect implementation of a Figma `saas landing page design` using modern frontend tools.

## 🎨 Overview

This project is a **Figma to Code** conversion that I built to practice and showcase my **frontend development skills** through real-world UI implementation.

It focuses on `clean structure`, `responsive layout`, and maintainable code.
